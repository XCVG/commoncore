LITERAL STRING (implemented in StringSubModule)

<p:"your string here">

double quotes inside literal string must be escaped with backslash, all other characters pass through

Why "p"? Because "s" and "l" are already taken. "p" is the next logical choice; p for Print

LOOKUP (implemented in StringSubModule)

Looks up an item in one of the lists in the static substitution table and replaces it.

<l:list:item>

ENVIRONMENT (implemented in EnvironmentStringSubber)

<%Data%>				Unity "Data" folder
<%GameFolder%>			Game exe root folder
<%PersistentData%>		CommonCore persistent data folder
<%LocalData%>			CommonCore local data folder
<%StreamingAssets%>		Unity "streaming assets" folder
<%Screenshots%>			CommonCore screenshots folder
<%AppData%>				Mono (roaming) AppData folder
<%LocalAppData%>		Mono local AppData folder
<%UserProfile%>			Mono user folder
<%MyDocuments%>			Mono My Documents folder
<%MyPictures%>			Mono My Pictures folder
<%MyVideos%>			Mono My Videos folder

<env:CurrentScene>			Name of the current scene
<env:Platform>				Unity platform string
<env:Identifier>			Unity application identifier
<env:ProductName>			Unity application product name
<env:CompanyName>			Unity application company name
<env:Version>				Unity application version
<env:VersionName>			CommonCore version name
<env:UnityVersion>			Unity version string
<env:CoreVersion>			CommonCore core version code
<env:CoreVersionName>		CommonCore core version name
<env:DeviceModel>			Unity SystemInfo device model
<env:DeviceName>			Unity SystemInfo device name
<env:DeviceType>			Unity SystemInfo device type
<env:GraphicsDeviceName>	Unity SystemInfo graphics device name
<env:GraphicsDeviceType>	Unity SystemInfo graphics device type (API)
<env:OperatingSystem>		Unity SystemInfo operating system name/version
<env:OperatingSystemFamily>	Unity SystemInfo operating system family
<env:ProcessorType>			Unity SystemInfo processor name
<env:MemorySize>			Unity SystemInfo system memory size

All except "env" are thread-safe guaranteed. All "env" may or may not be thread-safe.

RPG STATE (implemented in StateStringSubber)

Some of these are a little half-baked.

<av:actorvalue>		Called through to PlayerRpgState.GetAV
<inv:item>			Called through to PlayerRpgState.Inventory.CountItem
<invname:item>		Called through to InventoryModel.GetNiceName
<cpf:flag>			Checks a campaign flag, returns "true" or "false"
<cpv:variable>		Returns the contents of a campaign variable
<cqs:quest>			Returns the state of a quest
<cqname:quest>		Returns the name of a quest, if known (called through to QuestModel.GetNiceName)

PLAYER STRINGS (implemented in StateStringSubber)

<player:name>				The player's name
<player:shortname>			The player's short or first name (thunks to player:name currently)
<player:race>				The player's race. Will always return "human"
<player:pronoun>			The player's pronoun ("he", "she", "it", "they")
<player:pronounObj>			The player's possessive pronoun ("his", "hers", "its", "theirs")
<player:pronounPosObj>		The player's object possessive pronoun ("his, "her", "its", "their")
<player:pronounRef>			The player's reflexive pronoun ("himself", "herself", "itself", "themselves")
<player:pronounInt>			The player's intensive pronoun ("himself", "herself", "itself", "themselves")

Capitalization of the result will follow capitalization of the pattern:
	First letter lower case:				all lower case
	First letter upper case:				Capitalized first letter only
	First and second letter upper case:		ALL CAPS
Appending |keepcase will preserve case (experimental)

The "player" selector must always be lowercase.

The actual replacement strings for pronouns are stored in substitution lists:

ALIAS_NOGENDER			"it" pronouns, used for Sex.Undefined
ALIAS_FEMALE			"she" pronouns, used for Sex.Female
ALIAS_MALE				"he" pronouns, used for Sex.Male
ALIAS_NEUTRAL			"they" pronouns, used for Sex.Other

SCRIPT SUBSTITUTIONS (implemented in ScriptStringSubber)

Calls a script through the scripting system, inserts the result

<s:script|arg0|arg1|...argn>

There may be 0 to n args, separated by the | character. Putting a | character in a string arg will break.
