LITERAL STRING (implemented in StringSubModule)

<p:"your string here">

double quotes inside literal string must be escaped with backslash, all other characters pass through

Why "p"? Because "s" and "l" are already taken. "p" is the next logical choice; p for Print

An alternative supported in git versions only (will land in 4.0.0 preview 5):

<p:`your string here`>

backticks can be used instead of quotes, no characters need escaping but backticks cannot be used inside the string

LOOKUP (implemented in StringSubModule)

Looks up an item in one of the lists in the static substitution table and replaces it.

<l:list:item>

ENVIRONMENT (implemented in EnvironmentStringSubber)

<%Data%>				Unity "Data" folder
<%GameFolder%>			Game exe root folder
<%PersistentData%>		CommonCore persistent data folder
<%LocalData%>			CommonCore local data folder
<%StreamingAssets%>		Unity "streaming assets" folder
<%Screenshots%>			CommonCore screenshots folder
<%AppData%>				Mono (roaming) AppData folder
<%LocalAppData%>		Mono local AppData folder
<%UserProfile%>			Mono user folder
<%MyDocuments%>			Mono My Documents folder
<%MyPictures%>			Mono My Pictures folder
<%MyVideos%>			Mono My Videos folder

<env:CurrentScene>			Name of the current scene
<env:Platform>				Unity platform string
<env:Identifier>			Unity application identifier
<env:ProductName>			Unity application product name
<env:CompanyName>			Unity application company name
<env:Version>				Unity application version
<env:VersionName>			CommonCore version name
<env:UnityVersion>			Unity version string
<env:CoreVersion>			CommonCore core version code
<env:CoreVersionName>		CommonCore core version name
<env:DeviceModel>			Unity SystemInfo device model
<env:DeviceName>			Unity SystemInfo device name
<env:DeviceType>			Unity SystemInfo device type
<env:GraphicsDeviceName>	Unity SystemInfo graphics device name
<env:GraphicsDeviceType>	Unity SystemInfo graphics device type (API)
<env:OperatingSystem>		Unity SystemInfo operating system name/version
<env:OperatingSystemFamily>	Unity SystemInfo operating system family
<env:ProcessorType>			Unity SystemInfo processor name
<env:MemorySize>			Unity SystemInfo system memory size

All except "env" are thread-safe guaranteed. All "env" may or may not be thread-safe.

RPG STATE (implemented in StateStringSubber)

Some of these are a little half-baked.

<av:actorvalue>		Called through to PlayerRpgState.GetAV
<inv:item>			Called through to PlayerRpgState.Inventory.CountItem
<invname:item>		Called through to InventoryModel.GetNiceName
<cpf:flag>			Checks a campaign flag, returns "true" or "false"
<cpv:variable>		Returns the contents of a campaign variable
<cqs:quest>			Returns the state of a quest
<cqname:quest>		Returns the name of a quest, if known (called through to QuestModel.GetNiceName)

PLAYER STRINGS (implemented in StateStringSubber)

<player:name>				The player's name
<player:shortname>			The player's short or first name (thunks to player:name currently)
<player:race>				The player's race. Will always return "human"
<player:pronoun>			The player's pronoun ("he", "she", "it", "they")
<player:pronounObj>			The player's possessive pronoun ("his", "hers", "its", "theirs")
<player:pronounPosObj>		The player's object possessive pronoun ("his, "her", "its", "their")
<player:pronounRef>			The player's reflexive pronoun ("himself", "herself", "itself", "themselves")
<player:pronounInt>			The player's intensive pronoun ("himself", "herself", "itself", "themselves")

Capitalization of the result will follow capitalization of the pattern:
	First letter lower case:				all lower case
	First letter upper case:				Capitalized first letter only
	First and second letter upper case:		ALL CAPS
Appending |keepcase will preserve case (experimental)

The "player" selector must always be lowercase.

The actual replacement strings for pronouns are stored in substitution lists:

ALIAS_NOGENDER			"it" pronouns, used for Sex.Undefined
ALIAS_FEMALE			"she" pronouns, used for Sex.Female
ALIAS_MALE				"he" pronouns, used for Sex.Male
ALIAS_NEUTRAL			"they" pronouns, used for Sex.Other

SCRIPT SUBSTITUTIONS (implemented in ScriptStringSubber)

Calls a script through the scripting system, inserts the result

<s:script|arg0|arg1|...argn>

There may be 0 to n args, separated by the | character. Putting a | character in a string arg will break.
