IMAGES

Face images are located at Assets/char in katana and /Dialogue/char in CommonCore
Background images are located at Assets/bg in katana and /Dialogue/bg in CommonCore

The draw area is assumed to be 1280x720. It is constrained in katana and scaled in CommonCore

In CommonCore, 100 is assumed to be the default pixels per unit, and images are scaled according to this value

Images in the "character" position are drawn centered in katana, but 100px (or 140px if GameParams.DialogueDrawPortraitHigh is set) above center in CommonCore
Images in the "battler" position are drawn slightly offset in katana, but centered in CommonCore. They were never really supported in either.
Images in the "fill" position are stretched to the full draw area.

In CommonCore, some additional positions are supported:
	contain - Image is scaled, maintaining aspect ratio, to fit within the draw area
	cover - Image is scaled, maintaining aspect ratio, to fully cover the draw area
	characterBottom - Image is centered horizontally, pinned to the bottom vertically, scaled only by PixelsPerUnit

_______________________________________________________________________________

TIMED ADVANCE

The ImageFrame and TextFrame frame types can be set to move on to the next frame after a set period of time. Several properties are defined on the Frame to accomplish this:

useTimer
	Set this to true to enable timed advance

allowSkip
	Allows or disallows skipping the frame with the skip button. In CommonCore, this controls the existence of the skip button as well.

hideSkip
	Hides the skip button. Not implemented in CommonCore, where it is tied to allowSkip instead.

timeToShow
	How long to wait, in float seconds, until moving on to the next frame.

CONDITIONALS

the "conditional" is an array containing "conditionNodes"
each "conditionNode" contains a value for next and an array containing actual conditions that must be met

[
  { //condition node
    "next": "badScene",
    "conditions": [
      {
        "flag": "gotThing"
      },
      {
        "item": "idcard",
        "consume": false
      },
      {
        "variable": "encCounter",
        "greater": 5
      },
      {
        "quest": "d5DestroyTower",
        "started": false
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "next": "goodScene",
    "conditions": []
  }
]

conditionNodes are evaluated from last index to first index, and the first one that resolves true is used (implicit OR)
all conditions form an implicit AND within a node

AVAILABLE CONDITIONS:

flag: <flag>
noflag: <flag>
(checks if a flag is set or unset, no additional options)

item: <item>
	consume: *boolean*
(checks if the player has an item, uses it if specified [consume supported on Katana only])

variable: <variable>
	greater: *number*
	less: *number*
	equal: *number*
	greaterEqual: *number*
	lessEqual: *number*
(checks if a variable meets one of the tests, ONLY ONE AT A TIME IS SUPPORTED)

affinity: <character> [Katana only]
	(all supported by variable)
(checks if affinity meets one of the tests, similar to variable)

actorvalue: <path> [CommonCore only]
	(all supported by variable)
(checks if the actorvalue meets one of the tests, similar to variable, paths are exact variable names)

quest: <quest>
	(all supported by variable)
	started: *boolean* (quest > 0)
	finished: *boolean* (quest < 0)
(checks if quest meets one of the test, similar to variable but supports shorthands)

av: <actorvalue>
	(all supported by variable)

eval: *javascript*
(simply eval() the given code, naturally Katana only)

exec: <script name>
	arg: *any* (passed to script)
(special directive, looks up and executes a script through ASE engine, CommonCore only)

playerFlag: <PlayerFlag>
noPlayerFlag: <PlayerFlag>
(checks if a player flag is set or unset, no additional options, CommonCore only)

sessionFlag: <SessionFlag>
noSessionFlag: <SessionFlag>
(checks if a session flag is set or unset, no additional options, CommonCore only)

_______________________________________________________________________________


MICROSCRIPTS

each "microscript" is an array of directives

[
  {
    "flag": "d5Triggered",
    "set": true
  },
  {
    "quest": "d5Quest",
    "set": 1
  }
]

each directive has a target and an action
one action per directive please

AVAILABLE TARGETS
	(supported actions)

flag
	set, toggle
	
item
	give, take
	
variable
	set, add
	
affinity
	set, add

quest
	set, add, start, finish

av or actorvalue (CommonCore only)
	set, add

eval (Katana only)
	special directive, executes javascript passed as parameter

exec (CommonCore only)
	special directive, looks up and executes a script through ASE engine
	
playerFlag (CommonCore only)
	set, toggle
	
AVAILABLE ACTIONS

set: sets target to specified value
toggle: flag only, inverts existing value
add: adds specified value to target
give: for inventory: value=quantity, target=item
take: for inventory: value=quantity, target=item (value > 1 is undefined)
start: for quests, sets target to value if and only if quest is not started
finish: for quests, sets target to value if and only if quest is started

non-numeric arguments are technically supported but not recommended
	add is not defined and entirely at the mercy of javascript's type system
	start and finish just simply won't work
	this applies only to katana, not commoncore
 
_______________________________________________________________________________


MICROSCRIPT DELAY EXTENSIONS (CommonCore Only)

a microscript node can be scheduled for later execution:

[
  {
    "flag": "d5Triggered",
    "set": true,
	"delay": 60,
	"delayType": "world",
	"delayAbsolute": false
  }
]

delay
	delay in seconds

delayType [optional] [default = game]
	real, game, world
	
delayAbsolute [optional] [default = false]

There are three ways to reckon time, and the exact meaning of delayAbsolute changes based on them:
	REAL time: Time in the real world (technically system time). Never stops even if the game is closed. Absolute time is interpreted as seconds since January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT). Limited precision.
	GAME time: Time passing inside the game, affected by pause and Unity timescale, but not RPG timescale. Absolute time is interpreted as seconds in game since the game state was created.
	WORLD time: Time passing inside the world, ie affected by RPG timescale. Absolute time is interpreted as seconds in game since the game state was created.
	
Deferred events whose deadlines have passed will be executed as soon as possible. They do not expire.
	
_______________________________________________________________________________

SKILL CHECKS (CommonCore Only)

a choice node can optionally have a skill check attached

{
  "checkType": "soft", [optional, default = hard]
  "stat": "Dexterity", [condition]
  "greaterEqual": 5, [comparison]
  "passNext": "this.passed",
  "failNext": "meta.exit",
  "appendCheckText": true [optional, default = false]
}

all will include a condition/target and a comparison

AVAILABLE CONDITIONS:

skill: <skill>

stat: <stat>

actorvalue: <actorvalue>

AVAILABLE COMPARISONS

greater: *number*
less: *number*
equal: *number*
greaterEqual: *number*
lessEqual: *number*

Unlike conditionals, all comparisons are valid for all conditions

OTHER OPTIONS

checkType
	soft - Meeting requirements is a 100% pass chance. Not meeting requirements is scaled linearly from 0%. Not defined for equal comparison operator.
	hard - Must meet requirements exactly to pass. Supported fully for all comparison operators.
	
passNext - the frame to jump to if the check is passed
failNext - the frame to jump to if the check is failed

appendCheckText - If set, will prepend text that describes the skill check (ie [Dex 5])

_______________________________________________________________________________

CAMERA CONTROL (CommonCore Only)

The direction of the camera can be set with cameraDirection on the Frame object. It can be inherited from the Scene as well.

Default
	Sets the camera back to where it was.

FaceTarget:tid
	Will face the target specified by tid at a fixed distance (defaults to 1.0)
	If the : and tid are omitted, it will face the current target (which is by default the thing the dialogue was activated on)
	
CopyTransform:tid
	Copies the transform of the object specified by the TID

_______________________________________________________________________________

ADDITIONAL OPTIONS (CommonCore Only)

The options property of a Frame object defines some additional options for CommonCore only. It is inherited, so the scene can also have options which will be inherited by all of its Frames which can be overridden individually.

panelHeight (enum)
	default, full, half, variable, fixed
	How high to make the panel. Currently default (follows what is set in GameParams), full, half, fixed are supported and variable is not.

panelHeightPixels (float)
	How high to make the panel, in pixels, when fixed height is selected

hideNameText (boolean)
	Whether to hide the name text. Default is false.
	
voiceOverride (string)
	Override the voice clip name for this frame

voiceVolume (float)
	Override the voice clip volume for this frame

hideObjects (list<string>)
	Which objects in the scene to hide when this frame is displayed.
	Lookup is by TID (name in scene).
	It also accepts Player and Target which work the same as they do in camera control
	Putting a # in front of the name will cause it to be interpreted literally, ignoring Player and Target logic.

Several options are related to the conversation trace system added in CommonCore 3.0.0 Preview 3, which temporarily records the conversation path (meant to be used for a history window but that is not yet implemented).

traceDefaultSpeaker (enum)
	The "default" speaker used in conversation trace if nameText or traceSpeaker are not found, really more meant to be used in the scene rather than an individual frame. Can be None, PlayerLookup, PlayerName. PlayerName uses the player's CharacterModel DisplayName. PlayerLookup is not yet implemented.

traceSpeaker (string)
	The speaker name used in conversation trace for this frame. If not defined, nameText, then traceDefaultSpeaker will be used in that order.

traceText (string)
	The text used in conversation trace for this frame. If not defined, the normal text property of this frame will be used.

traceIncludeChoices (string)
	Whether to include choices in the conversation trace (defaults to false).

traceIncludeNextText (bool)
	Whether to include the nextText in the conversation trace (defaults to false).

traceNextTextSpeaker (string)
	The speaker name used for nextText in conversation trace. If not set, default speaker defined by traceDefaultSpeaker will be used.

traceNextTextText (string)
	The text used for nextText in conversation trace. If not defined, the normal text property of this frame will be used.
_______________________________________________________________________________

TRACE ON CHOICES (CommonCore Only)

Trace options are also supported on choice nodes.

traceSpeaker (string)
	The speaker name used for this choice node. If not set, default speaker defined by traceDefaultSpeaker will be used.

traceText (string)
	The text used for this choice node. If not set, the text property of the choice node will be used.

traceIgnore (bool)
	If set, the choice node will be omitted from conversation trace even if traceIncludeChoices is set on the containing Frame.

traceShow (bool)
	If set, the choice node will be shown in the conversation trace even if traceIncludeChoices is false/unset on the containing Frame. If both traceIgnore and traceShow are set the behaviour is undefined.

_______________________________________________________________________________

SCRIPT CALLS (CommonCore Only)

The scripts property of a Frame object defines some additional scripts for CommonCore only. It is inherited, so the scene can also have scripts which will be inherited by all of its Frames which can be overridden individually.

Each of these is a string that refers to a script in the CommonCore scripting system.

beforePresent
	Runs before the frame is presented

onPresent
	Runs after the frame is presented
	
onChoice
	Runs after a choice is chosen (including the "next" on TextFrame)
	
onUnpresent
	Runs before a frame is cleared, before the next one is presented

_______________________________________________________________________________

EXTRADATA (CommonCore Only)

An ExtraData property on the Frame allows adding extra data as a generic JSON object (internally it converts to IReadOnlyDictionary<string,object>). It is also available on the Scene object and is inherited, with individual properties on the frame overriding those on the base. Note that while ExtraData itself is immutable, objects contained within it may not be.
