# Additional assets not included in repository

While CommonCore makes use of many external third-party assets, the base library and demo/example project no longer require these.

Most dependencies are included. A few of them are pulled in automatically as Unity packages:

- Post-Processing Stack (https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.postprocessing@3.2/manual/index.html)
- Json.NET for Unity (https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json@3.0/manual/index.html)

You can get the extra CommonCore modules at (https://github.com/XCVG/commoncore-modules). Some modules do have third-party dependencies.

There is no dependency on the Unity Standard Assets but you can bring them in if you need to.

# A note on WebGL Templates

The WebGL templates in Assets/WebGLTemplates are in a bit of an ambiguous licensing situation. They are based on the built-in templates shipped with Unity (as per Unity's own recommendation), with some modifications and with trademarked Unity assets stripped out.
